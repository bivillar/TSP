This is a project for PUC-Rio AI class that has the objective of implementing two different metaheuristics algorithms for solving TSP problem. The chosen algorithms were Genetic and Farthest Insertion.

## Getting Started

This project is composed by two parts, the client (ReactJS) and the server (NodeJS) for saving the output files.
